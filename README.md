## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I always assumed that GitHub was the Web Developer's version of LinkedIn. Though it is a great tool for sharing your skills and resumes, I never realized you could collaborate on work through GitHub.
2. I never knew the difference between a local and remote repository before this lesson. Now I know that local repositories are local working files and remote repositories are the main server/repository holding the original files.
3. I learned the importance of Version Control. In my job I've had to work with a main server shared by multiple employees. Files have been corrupted and overwritten and it's nice to know that there is a more efficient way for multiple users to work on files together without having to just use the "save as" function.
