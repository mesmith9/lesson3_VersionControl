            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control allows users to track files over a period of time. Any changes, modifications, and updates are tracked and the source of those changes are recorded so, if needed, work can be reverted. Different versions can be compared to find the source of conflict or the source of mistakes in files. Through Version Control, mistakes can be corrected without wasting a lot of time or losing work. Version Control also allows users to work on files at the same time without corrupting the source repository. With Version Control, multiple users can contribute to the creation and updating of files and allow efficient collaboration.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a web-based version control repository where users can collaborate remotely and contribute to users’ work. Mainly, GitHub is popular for its efficiency with collaboration among web developers. It is one of the more popular Git version control systems. Github hosts both public and private repositories depending on the price the account is set to. A feature of GitHub is that it is cloud based, and allows code to be reviewed by a large community if that is the user’s preference. Another great feature of GitHub is the ability to integrate to other websites such as Cloud9 and Google.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Remote Repository is the main server where files are saved and where files are shared. The Remote Repository is stored on a local network or hosted on the internet. Changes to files are made and uploaded to the Remote Repository to be accessed by all collaborators. Remote Repositories allow files to be shared in order for those files to become “working files”. Remote Repositories can be copied or cloned to a local repository using Git commands in order to become changeable files.  Working files can be pushed and uploaded to the Remote Repository and merged with existing files. Using a version control system, these merges and changes can be tracked.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Local Repository in essence is the opposite of the remote repository. It is stored locally on a user’s machine so the files can become “working files”. Changes and modifications can be made on files in the Local Repository and then be staged, pushed, uploaded to the remote repository. Multiple users can make a copy of the remote repository on their own machine, make individual changes that won’t corrupt the original remote repository files. This creates a sort of quality control because many users can collaborate on the same project at the same time without the fear of making permanent mistakes to the original files and data.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands are the keystrokes and abbreviated word command methods that allow files to be uploaded, merged, copied, cloned to and from the remote repository. A user can utilize Git commands to commit and add changes on files to the main server and to check the status of files to see what was changed (git status). Repositories can also be created using Git Commands (git init). Repositories can be cloned using Git Commands (git clone). You can transmit local changes to the remote server (git push). There are many Git Commands for different actions and by using the command line you can use this shorthand method to perform Version Control on Git or other VCS.</p>
